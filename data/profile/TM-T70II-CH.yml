TM-T70II-CH:
  name: TM-T70II Chinese
  vendor: "Epson"
  notes: >
      Epson TM-T70II Chinese models. This profile applies to both Traditional
      Chinese and Simplified Chinese models. These models are 203dpi so they
      print more columns per line than the ANK model. They also support the
      same character fonts (ESC M) and code pages (ESC t) as the ANK model but
      they each have different Kanji fonts (FS &) than the other. The
      Traditional Chinese model uses Big5 for Kanji encoding and the
      Simplified Chinese model uses GB18030-2022 Level 2.
